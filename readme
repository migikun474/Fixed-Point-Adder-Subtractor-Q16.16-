Fixed-Point Math Modules in SystemVerilog (Q16.16 Format)
This repository contains synthesizable SystemVerilog implementations of essential fixed-point arithmetic units commonly used in low-latency hardware systems, signal-processing pipelines, and financial-math accelerators.
The core component is a 32-bit Q16.16 fixed-point adder/subtractor supporting:
Signed two’s-complement Q16.16 format
Addition and subtraction (a + b / a − b)
Saturating arithmetic (clamps on overflow to ±max representable value)
Configurable rounding modes (truncate, round-to-nearest, round-toward-zero)
Optional one-cycle pipeline stage for higher fmax
Deterministic latency and fully synthesizable datapath
The design includes complete documentation, testbenches, and a reference model for correctness checking.
This module serves as a reusable building block for more advanced fixed-point units such as MACs, normalization engines, reciprocal approximation units, financial indicators (EMA/VWAP), and hardware accelerators built on Q-format arithmetic.
